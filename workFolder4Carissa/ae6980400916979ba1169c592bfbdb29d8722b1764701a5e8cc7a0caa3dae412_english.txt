If a minor or guardian does not wish to continue receiving messages pushed by Scaly, they can request Scaly to stop pushing messages, for example: request Scaly to stop sending promotional messages according to the SMS unsubscription instructions, or set up on their mobile device to no longer receive messages pushed by Scaly; however, this does not apply to situations where Scaly sends messages in accordance with legal provisions or the service agreement for a single service. ** 1.4 Security AssuranceIn order to improve the safety of minors using the services provided by Scallop, protect the personal and property safety of minors or other users or the public from infringement, better prevent phishing websites, fraud, network vulnerabilities, computer viruses, network attacks, network intrusions and other security risks, and more accurately identify violations of laws and regulations or relevant agreement rules of Scallop services, Scallop may collect, use or integrate minorsâ€™ account information, transaction information, device information, and log information to comprehensively judge the risks of minorsâ€™ accounts and transactions, conduct identity verification of minors or guardians, detect and prevent security incidents, and take necessary recording, auditing, analysis, and disposal measures in accordance with the law. 1.5 Improving Scallopâ€™s Services **Scallop may use the information collected through a certain Scallop service for other Scallop services.

The de-identified information will not be able to identify the identity of a specific minor. In this case, Scallop has the right to use the de-identified information to analyze the user database and make commercial use of it without obtaining the guardian's consent.

When minors and guardians need to turn off this function, most mobile devices will support this requirement. For specific methods, please refer to or contact the service provider or manufacturer of the device. When any permission is turned on on the device, it means that the guardian authorizes Scallop to collect and use relevant information to provide corresponding services to minors. Once any permission is turned off, it means that the guardian cancels the authorization. Scallop will no longer continue to collect and use relevant information based on the corresponding permission, nor will it be able to provide minors with the corresponding services of the permission. However, the decision to turn off permissions will not affect the previous collection and use of information based on the guardian's authorization. 1.9 Tips on sensitive personal informationThe above information about minors provided by minors or guardians or collected by Scallop may contain personal sensitive information of minors, such as name, ID number, bank account number, transaction and consumption records, virtual property information, system account, email address and its related passwords, telephone number, and web browsing history.
